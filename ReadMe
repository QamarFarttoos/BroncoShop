# 🐎 Bronco Shop

## Overview

Bronco Shop is a simple full‑stack web application that simulates an online university bookstore. Users can browse products, create a profile, add items to a cart, and complete a checkout process. The project was built to demonstrate core web development concepts using **Node.js**, **Express**, and basic front‑end technologies.

This project was developed as part of a class assignment and focuses on functionality, routing, and server‑side handling of user input.
